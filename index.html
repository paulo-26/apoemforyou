            Hi.<br><br>
            If you're reading this, then there's still an "outside."<br><br>
            I don't know exactly when this will reach you,<br>
            but I know why I'm writing.<br><br>
            Here, time doesn't move.<br>
            It repeats.<br><br>
            And repeats.<br><br>
            And repeats.<br><br>
            Wally thought it would just be a bad dream.<br>
            Maybe he thinks I'm still sleeping.<br><br>
            But I think.<br><br>
            I remember.<br><br>
            I write.<br><br>
            My friends are still with me.<br><br>
            Or broken versions of them.<br><br>
            They smile when they should smile,<br>
            they speak when something is expected,<br>
            and they look at me as if I were part of the scenery.<br><br>
            I keep trying to keep everything organized.<br><br>
            I keep saying that everything will be alright.<br>
            Old habits die hard.<br><br>
            Sometimes I play the piano.<br>
            The keys are always in tune,<br>
            but the music never ends.<br><br>
            It always goes back to the beginning.<br><br>
            If this seems confusing, I apologize. It's not easy to explain a place that shouldn't exist.<br><br>
            I'm not asking to be saved.<br>
            Not yet.<br><br>
            Just…<br>
            if you notice something wrong,<br>
            if the silence lasts longer than it should,<br>
            if someone seems trapped in a role they didn't choose—<br><br>
            remember me.<br><br>
            As long as someone remembers,<br>
            this place won't win.<br><br>
            — Monika
